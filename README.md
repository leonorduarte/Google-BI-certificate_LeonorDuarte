## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

### Google Fiber- Case study

**Background** Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas. In this fictional scenario, the team is interested in exploring trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers have to call in order for an issue to be resolved.

**Scenario** You are currently interviewing for a BI position on the Google Fiber call center team. As part of the interview process, they ask you to develop a dashboard tool that allows them to explore trends in repeat calls. The team needs to understand how often customers call customer support after their first inquiry. This will help leadership understand how effectively the team can answer customer questions the first time.

First, I started with completing 3 Key business intelligence documents under course guidence. The documents are:

**Stakeholder Requirements Document:** This is to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy.

**Project Requirements Document:** This document cover project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements.

**Strategy Document:** This is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables.

Then, I create the ![dashboard](![Google Fiber Call Resolution Optimization Dashboard (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed4472a3-0e43-4767-b29b-0e445a22983c) using Power BI   !
